About Dataset
Context
There's a story behind every dataset and here's your opportunity to share yours.
training data was automatically created, as opposed to having humans manual annotate tweets. In our approach, we assume that any tweet with positive emoticons, like :), were positive, and tweets with negative emoticons, like :(, were negative.

Content
What's inside is more than just rows and columns. Make it easy for others to get started by describing how you acquired the data and what time period it represents, too.
The data is a CSV with emoticons removed. Data file format has 6 fields:
0 - the polarity of the tweet (0 = negative, 2 = neutral, 4 = positive)
1 - the id of the tweet (2087)
2 - the date of the tweet (Sat May 16 23:58:44 UTC 2009)
3 - the query (lyx). If there is no query, then this value is NO_QUERY.
4 - the user that tweeted (robotickilldozr)
5 - the text of the tweet (Lyx is cool)
